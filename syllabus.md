#### Course Overview

In this course, the second semester required writing course at Baruch, you will develop your ability to read, write, and think critically. One of the most important abilities you’ll develop over the course of your studies (and hopefully throughout your life) is the ability to discern how the way we think is shaped by language and other semiotic codes such as sound and images. This course will ask that you think critically about the arguments of others and in turn develop and communicate your own ideas and arguments.

For our course theme, we will explore the current and emergent conditions of the Digital Age, with attention to the writing and literacy technologies at the heart of its unfolding history. In turn, we will reflect on how these technologies mediate and shape our writing, reading, and thinking practices all across the digital universe. If indeed language makes worlds, then we will consider how digital technology molds and shapes those worlds in ways seldom visible to the naked eye. Our inquiry will flesh out how these technologies at once enable and constrain the scope of our knowledge and know-how, determining where and how we find information. We will also investigate the fabric of personal identity, data, and privacy when entangled with social media and its surveillance technology. Our goal through this process will be to converge on what it means to critically and ethically interact with digital technology — and how by extension we can learn to assert greater control over our lives as digital citizens of the world.

#### Learning Goals

1. Read and analyze texts critically: analyze and interpret key ideas in various discursive genres (e.g. essays, news articles, speeches, poems, movies, short stories), with careful attention to the role of rhetorical conventions such as style, tropes, genre, audience, and purpose.
2. Write your own texts critically: compose with an awareness of your own rhetorical situation (audience, purpose, genre, medium) and the role personal experience and social convention play in shaping how and what we write.
3. Identify and engage with credible sources and multiple perspectives: identify sources of information and evidence credible to your audience; incorporate multiple perspectives in your writing by summarizing, interpreting, critiquing, and synthesizing the arguments of others; and avoid plagiarism by ethically acknowledging the work of others when used in your own writing, using a citation style appropriate to your audience and purpose.
4. Compose as a process: experience writing as a creative way of thinking and generating knowledge and as a process involving multiple drafts, review of your work by members of your discourse community (e.g. instructor and peers), revision, and editing, reinforced by reflecting on your writing process in metacognitive ways.
5. Use conventions appropriate to audience, genre, and purpose: adapt writing and composing conventions (including your style, content, organization, document design, word choice, syntax, citation style, sentence structure, and grammar) to your rhetorical context.
